# Components


All inherit `Component` — fluent `on_*` chaining, state properties,
source-aware events. Import from `neony.application.elements`.

Overlay roots can call `set_outside_click(True / False)` to enable or
disable the marker for synthetic ``outsideclick`` delivery.

## Form controls

### `Button`

```python
Button("Primary")  # accent bg
Button("Ghost", variant="ghost")  # bordered surface
Button("Delete", variant="danger")  # danger color
Button("Glass", glass=True)  # frosted variant
Button("Ok", disabled=True)  # dimmed
button.on_click(handler)  # click event
```

### `Checkbox`

```python
cb = Checkbox("Pizza")
cb.checked = True  # programmatic — no callback
cb.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = checked bool
```

### `Input`

```python
inp = Input(placeholder="Your name…", type="text")  # text | password | email | number …
inp.on_input(lambda e: print(e.value))  # live value
```

### `Radio` & `RadioGroup`

```python
group = RadioGroup(Radio("Pizza"), Radio("Tacos"))
group.value  # selected value (defaults to lowercased label)
group.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = selected value string
group.value = "tacos"  # programmatic — no callback
```

Exactly one option is checked at a time; the group assigns a shared
`name` so screen readers treat it as one control. A `Radio` used alone
is a plain toggle with `on_change` carrying the bool.

### `Switch`

```python
sw = Switch("Wi-Fi")
sw.bind_value(flag)  # two-way: binds checked
sw.checked = True  # programmatic — no callback
sw.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = checked bool
```

Use `bind_value` when the switch only mirrors application state. Keep a
named handler when a change must perform work beyond synchronization:

```python
async def on_wifi_change(event: DomEvent) -> None:
    await persist_setting(bool(event.value))
    status.set("saved")


sw.on_change(on_wifi_change)
```

A native checkbox styled as a track + thumb (38×22px, `glass=True` for
a frosted track).

### `Select`

```python
sel = Select("Size", options=[("s", "Small"), ("m", "Medium")], placeholder="Pick…")
sel.value  # selected option value ("m")
sel.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = selected option value
```

Options are `str` (value == label) or `(value, label)` tuples. The
popup is drawn by the component — a themed glass panel of rows — since
WebKitGTK's native popup ignores option `background-color`. Keyboard:
Enter/Space opens, ArrowDown/Up highlights, Enter picks, Escape/Tab
closes; click-away closes.

### `ComboBox`

```python
box = ComboBox("Tag", options=["work", "personal"], placeholder="Type or pick…")
tag = Signal("")
box.bind_value(tag)  # typing and suggestion picks both write tag
```

For simple echoes, the binding is enough. For validation, persistence, or
other asynchronous work, use the event stream instead (or use both):

```python
async def on_tag_change(event: DomEvent) -> None:
    await save_tag(event.value)
    audit_log.append(event.value)


box.on_change(on_tag_change)  # event.value is the committed text
```

Editable text with a themed suggestion popup (the native `<datalist>`
popup cannot be themed). The popup opens on focus — a single click
shows every option; suggestions filter by prefix as you type.

ArrowDown/Up highlights, **Tab or Enter auto-completes** the
highlighted suggestion, **PageUp/PageDown pick the first/last
suggestion in one keypress**, Escape / click-away closes. Value
semantics match `Input`: `on_input` records state only, `on_change`
fires on a pick or blur.

### `Slider`

```python
sl = Slider("Volume", min=0, max=100, step=5, value=40)
sl = Slider("Volume", min=0, max=100, step="any")  # stepless
sl.value  # 40.0 — clamped to [min, max]
sl.on_input(lambda e: print(e.value))  # float, while dragging
sl.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # float, on release
```

The visible track, accent fill and knob are drawn by the component
(the native range input on top is invisible and owns drag / keyboard).

The fill follows the thumb instantly while dragging and glides over
0.2s on programmatic sets. `step="any"` reaches every float.

PageUp/PageDown move by a page step (10× step, or 10% of the range
when stepless) — the component corrects the native range input's
reversed page direction (WebKit spec quirk).

### `Progress`

```python
bar = Progress("Downloading…", value=35, max=100)
bar.value = 50  # clamped to [0, max]; the fill glides over 0.3s
Progress("Scanning…", indeterminate=True)  # sliding sweep animation
```

A rounded track with an accent fill that transitions on value changes
(`indeterminate=True` plays the built-in `neony-indeterminate` sweep).

ARIA `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow/min/max` are carried on the
bar.

## Text & tabs

### `Heading` & `Text`

```python
Heading("Title", level=1)  # h1–h6
Text("Body copy")  # primary
Text("Muted", role="secondary")  # muted
Text("Error", role="danger")  # danger
Text("OK", role="success")  # success
```

### `Tabs`

```python
tabs = Tabs(("One", panel_one), ("Two", panel_two))  # or tabs.add("One", panel_one)
tabs.selected_panel = panel_two  # programmatic switch (component or element)
tabs.selected_title  # title of the active tab
tabs.selected_key = "Two"  # title-as-key selection
tabs.bind_selected(active)  # Signal[str] ↔ selected tab
tabs.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = tab title
```

**Options:** `Tabs(*panes, glass, edge_fade=True)` — `*panes` are
`(title, panel)` pairs, equivalent to chained `add()` calls.

`edge_fade` toggles the scroll indicator (floating thumb + dynamic edge
fade) on the tab strip — set `False` to suppress it.

`selected_panel` binds the visible panel (the Component or its built
root — matched by identity, never rebuilt); `selected_title` selects by
title string and raises `ValueError` for unknown titles. `active`
(index) and `active_key` (tab title) are deprecated aliases for the
`selected_*` properties.

### `Accordion` & `Collapsible`

```python
accordion = (
    Accordion(multiple=True)
    .section("Inputs & Forms", inputs_panel, checks_panel)
    .section("Layout", layout_panel, expanded=True)
)
accordion.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # value = key of toggled section
accordion.expanded_keys = ["inputs & forms"]  # programmatic — no callback
accordion.expanded_keys  # list[str], the open sections
```

A `Collapsible` is one titled row that toggles a content panel between
hidden and visible; an `Accordion` stacks them in a single scroll flow.

With `multiple=True` (the default) several sections can stay open; with
`multiple=False` opening one closes the others. Only the `display`
property switches — expanding replays the built-in `neony-rise-in`
entrance animation.

`Collapsible(title, *content, expanded=False, key=None)` builds a single
section (also accepted positionally by `Accordion`); `key` defaults to
the lowercased title and identifies the section in `change` payloads.

`.section(title, *content, ...)` is the fluent shorthand that builds a
`Collapsible` and appends it in one call.

Listen with `on_change` (`event.value` is the key of the section the
user just toggled) and read the full open set with `expanded_keys`.

`Accordion` does **not** implement `selected_key` / `bind_selected` —
its selection is multi-valued, which does not fit the single-value
selection protocol.

## Overlays & feedback

### `Dialog`

```python
dlg = Dialog(
    title="Confirm",
    content=Text("..."),
    width="380px",
    actions=[
        DialogAction("确认", on_click=confirm_handler),  # runs, then closes
        DialogAction("取消", variant="ghost"),
        DialogAction("关闭", close_on_click=False),  # runs, stays open
    ],
)
dlg.open = True  # or read the property
dlg.on_close(lambda d: print("closed"))  # called with the dialog
```

A fixed full-page scrim (`--color-bg-overlay`, theme-following) with a
centered panel. Close paths: scrim click, Escape (while focus is
inside), or click-away. `closable=False` disables only
the scrim. `actions` render as a row of themed buttons — `DialogAction`
takes a label (positional), a `variant` (`primary`/`ghost`/`danger`),
an `on_click` callback (called with the dialog, sync or async) and
`close_on_click` (default True). NOTE: any `backdrop-filter` /
`transform` ancestor becomes the containing block for
`position: fixed` — mount the dialog at the page root or in a
non-filtered container.

### `PromptDialog`

```python
ask = PromptDialog(
    "What's your name?",  # the question above the field
    title="Identify",
    value="Ada",  # pre-fill; also resettable via ask.value
    placeholder="Type…",
)
ask.open = True  # or read the property
ask.on_submit(lambda v: print(f"got {v}"))  # confirm / Enter, with the value
ask.on_close(lambda d: print("closed"))  # inherited from Dialog
```

A `Dialog` specialised for a single text value: a themed scrim + centered
panel with a message, one `Input` field, and a confirm / cancel row.

Confirming (the primary button, or pressing `Enter` while the field has
focus) fires `on_submit` with the field's current value, then closes;
cancelling (the ghost button, `Escape`, scrim click, or click-away)
closes without firing it. `value` is the field's text — set it before
opening to pre-fill, read it after submit. `prompt`, `confirm_label`,
`cancel_label`, and `placeholder` are configurable. Same `position:
fixed` caveat as `Dialog` — mount at the page root.

### `Tooltip`

```python
tip = Tooltip("hint", anchor=Button("Hover"), placement="top", delay=0.4)
```

Wraps its anchor (a component is built on construction; a string is
wrapped in a Span) and shows a bubble after `delay` seconds of hover,
anchored per `placement` (`top` / `bottom` / `left` / `right`) — pure
CSS offsets, no measurement. The wrapper bubbles hover events from the
anchor; clicking the anchor (focus) shows the bubble immediately, blur
hides it.

### `Dropdown`

```python
dd = Dropdown("Theme", items=[("dark", "Dark"), ("light", "Light")])
choice = Signal("")
dd.bind_value(choice)  # two-way: selection writes choice
dd.value  # selected value
```

Use a named `on_change` handler when selection triggers more than a state
write, such as an asynchronous reload or several related updates:

```python
async def on_theme_change(event: DomEvent) -> None:
    await reload_theme(event.value)
    status.set(f"loaded: {event.value}")


dd.on_change(on_theme_change)
```

A trigger with a themed glass popup of native button rows (the same
pattern as `Select`). Full keyboard nav (Enter/Space opens, arrows
clamp at the ends, PageUp/PageDown jump to first/last, Enter picks,
Escape/Tab and click-away close). `items` is settable.

### `CascadingDropdown`

```python
menu = CascadingDropdown(
    "Account",
    items=[
        ("profile", "Profile"),
        MenuBranch(
            "Share",
            [
                ("copy", "Copy link"),
                ("email", "Email"),
                MenuBranch("More", [("embed", "Embed"), ("print", "Print")]),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

A selector with recursively nested option branches. Unlike `Menu`, it
keeps the `Dropdown` trigger lifecycle: one trigger, one popup, the same
click-away / Escape close path, and the full keyboard navigation.
`MenuBranch(label, items)` renders a row whose child panel opens beside
it (with a chevron); `Enter` / `ArrowRight` enter a branch. Selections
report a leaf value through the standard Dropdown `on_change` /
`bind_value` API.

### `Menu`

```python
menu = Menu(
    ("rename", "Rename"),
    ("delete", "Delete"),
    MenuBranch(
        "Export",
        [("csv", "CSV"), ("json", "JSON"), MenuBranch("More", [("pdf", "PDF")])],
    ),
)
btn.on_contextmenu(lambda e: menu.open_at(e.x, e.y))  # cursor position
menu.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))
```

A fixed popup positioned with `open_at(x, y)` — typically a
`contextmenu` event's viewport coordinates, so no measurement is
needed. Same keyboard nav as `Dropdown`; closes on selection, Escape,
or click-away. The panel pops upward — its bottom edge anchors 8px
above the cursor — and clamps to the viewport via `calc()` max
width/height, so it never overflows an edge. `MenuBranch(label, items)`
adds a cascading branch: `ArrowRight` / `Enter` opens the child menu,
`ArrowLeft` returns to the parent level, and Escape closes one menu
level at a time before the whole tree.

### `Toast`

```python
toast = Toast(placement="top-right", duration=3.0, top_offset="40px")
page.add(toast)  # mount once at the page root
toast.show("File saved", type="success")  # success / info / error
toast.show("Update available", type="info", duration=5.0)
toast.show("New message", on_click=open_it)  # click the card (✕ excluded)
toast.placement = "bottom-left"  # relocate the stack live
toast.clear()  # remove everything
```

A host component stacking transient notifications at one of six screen
edges (`top-left` / `top-center` / `top-right` / `bottom-left` /
`bottom-center` / `bottom-right`). `show(text, type=...)` pushes a
card — `success` / `info` / `error` pick the accent dot colour;
`duration` overrides the host default per call, and `0` sticks until
the ✕ is clicked. `on_click` (sync or async) fires when the card is
clicked — the ✕ never fires it — and the card shows a pointer cursor
when it's clickable. `max_toasts` evicts the oldest card beyond the cap.

`top_offset` drops the top placements below window chrome (a `TitleBar`
height); bottom placements always hug the window edge. Each card enters
with a placement-specific directional animation (top placements drop
in, bottom ones rise up, corners slide diagonally) and leaves by
replaying the same keyframe reversed toward that edge. The host is a
full-viewport `position: fixed` layer at z-index 1100 with
`pointer-events: none` (clicks pass through to the page) — mount it at
the page root, away from `backdrop-filter` / `transform` ancestors.

## Content

### `Image`

```python
from neony.application.urls import file_url, data_url

img = Image(file_url("cover.png"), width=120, height=120, fit="cover", radius="12px")
img.src = data_url("other.svg")  # any URL string
```

A themed frame around a single `<img>`. `src` is an **already-built URL**
— pass it `file_url(path)` for a local file, `local_url(path)` to stream
it over the built-in `neony://local` protocol (works where `file://` is
blocked), `data_url(path)` to embed the
bytes, or any `https://` URL; the component expects a prebuilt URL and
does not convert paths for you. A rounded, overflow-hidden
frame wraps the image so `object-fit` can crop to the radius and a
placeholder tint shows before the bytes arrive. `width`/`height` accept
`str` (`"40%"`) or `int` (→ `"40px"`). `fit` is `object-fit`
(`cover`/`contain`/`fill`/`none`/`scale-down`); pass `radius="50%"` for a
circle. `src` and `alt` are settable after construction.

### `Video`

```python
from neony.application.urls import local_url

clip = Video(local_url(Path("clip.mp4").resolve()), width=560, radius="12px")
await clip.play()
await clip.seek(12.5)
await clip.set_volume(0.4)
```

A fully managed, themed video player. Native controls are never shown —
playback runs through the built-in transport row (play/pause, position
slider with scrubbing, time labels, mute, volume) built from regular
Neony widgets and updated reactively from media events. Sources are
owned by the component: pass `local_url(path)` to stream over the
built-in `neony://local` protocol and the runtime loads it
automatically, or pass any `https://`/`data:` URL for the native path;
switching between the two at runtime is handled for you
(`bind_src(signal)` keeps it declarative). For local MP4 files whose
codec the webview cannot decode (HEVC `hvc1`/`hev1`), the runtime
detects it and transparently transcodes to H.264 via `imageio-ffmpeg`,
caching the result next to the original as `<file>.transcoded.mp4`.
Commands: `play()`, `pause()`, `seek(seconds)`, `set_muted(bool)`,
`toggle_muted()`, `set_volume(0..1)`. Events: `on_play`, `on_pause`,
`on_ended`, `on_timeupdate`, `on_error`. Reactive reads: `playing`,
`position`, `duration`, `muted`, `volume`. Options: `poster`,
`width`/`height` (`int` → px), `radius`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`,
`preload`.

### `Audio`

```python
song = Audio(local_url(Path("song.mp3").resolve()), width=420)
song.on_ended(lambda event: playlist.advance())
await song.toggle_muted()
```

The same managed player as [`Video`](#video), presented as a compact
control card. The ownership model, transport row, commands, events, and
options match — minus the picture surface — and HEVC transcode fallback
applies too. `width` sizes the card; `media_styles` overrides only the
inner native media element's styles.

### `Avatar`

```python
av = Avatar("https://…/me.png", name="Ada Lovelace", size="56px")
letter = Avatar(name="Ada", size="40px")  # → "A" on an accent disc
unknown = Avatar()  # → "?" placeholder
inbox = Avatar(src, name="Inbox", badge=Badge(3, position="top-right"))
```

A user avatar — image, letter initial, or placeholder. With `src` the
image is shown (cropped by `object-fit: cover`); with only `name` it
falls back to the first character (uppercased) on an accent disc; with
neither it shows a `?` placeholder. `shape` is `circle` (default) or
`square`; `radius` overrides the shape's corner radius. `alt` overrides
the image alt text (otherwise `name` is used). An optional `badge` (a
corner `Badge`) is overlaid — the avatar wraps itself in a relative
inline-flex container so the badge can anchor to a corner. `src`, `name`,
and `size` are settable after construction.

### `Badge`

```python
Badge("New", variant="accent")  # inline pill
Badge(150)  # → "99+" (default max=99)
Badge(0)  # hidden (display:none); Badge(0, show_zero=True) shows
Badge(dot=True)  # status dot, no text
Badge(3, position="top-right")  # corner count — needs a position:relative parent
```

A small status label or corner count — one class, two shapes.

`position="inline"` (default) is a pill that flows with text, tinted by
`variant` (`neutral` default, `accent`, `danger`, `success`). Any other
`position` (`top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`)
absolutely positions the badge as a corner count — **the component assumes
a `position: relative` parent** (an `Avatar` with `badge=`, or a wrapper
`Div`); `overlap=True` pushes it further out (`-12px`) to overlap the
parent's edge. Integer content gets two conveniences: counts above `max`
(default 99) collapse to `"99+"`, and a zero count hides the badge unless
`show_zero=True` (the node stays mounted so it can toggle back).

`dot=True` drops the text for a bare status dot. `content`, `variant`, and
`dot` are settable after construction.

### `Card`

```python
card = Card(
    Text("The body holds any children."),
    title="My card",
    subtitle="Optional subtitle",
    actions=[Button("Edit")],
    footer=[Button("Cancel"), Button("OK")],
    glass=True,
    role="accent",
)
card.title = "Renamed"
```

A titled content panel. `*body` is the panel body (Components, DOMElements,
or strings). `title` / `subtitle` auto-build a header (a `Heading` + an
optional secondary `Text`); a custom `header=` slot replaces the title row
entirely (and takes precedence over `title`/`subtitle`/`actions`).

`actions` are buttons shown right-aligned in the header row; `footer` is a
button list (right-aligned, above a separator) or any content node.

`glass=True` swaps the solid surface for a frosted-glass panel tinted by
`role` (`neutral` default, `accent`, `danger`, `success` — the glow follows
the theme). `clickable=True` turns the card into a clickable surface
(`cursor: pointer` + `on_click`). `title` and `subtitle` are settable
after construction. Card keeps its own compact style constants (it does
not wrap `GlassPanel`), so it stays light by default.

### `MessageBubble`

```python
other = MessageBubble(
    "Hey! Have you seen the new gallery?",
    avatar=Avatar(name="Ada"),
    name="Ada",
    actions=[("reply", "Reply"), Icon.glyph("😊")],
)
me = MessageBubble("Hi!", from_me=True)
other.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # right-click menu selection
other.on_action(lambda v: print(v))  # quick action click
```

A single chat message. `from_me` flips the
row's alignment (self → right, others → left) and the bubble fill
(self → accent with white text, others → raised surface); the corner
toward the avatar is squared off. `avatar` is an optional `Avatar` on
the message's own side (built on construction), `name` an optional
sender label above the bubble. `actions` renders quick buttons below
the bubble that appear on hover — a `(value, label)` pair or `str`
becomes a text button, an `Icon` an icon button; clicking fires
`on_action(value)`. The action row is absolutely positioned below the
bubble, so showing it overlays the message beneath instead of shifting
the row's height. Within one window, only the currently hovered message
shows its quick-action row. `menu_items` configures the built-in right-click
`Menu` (default Copy / Delete; `[]` disables it — `on_contextmenu`
still fires) and selections dispatch to `on_change` with the value;
within one window, opening this cursor menu closes any previously open
cursor menu.

NOTE: the menu is a `position: fixed` element inside the bubble; keep
chat panes away from `backdrop-filter` / `transform` ancestors.

Quick actions also support `actions_placement="below" | "beside"`,
`action_size`, `name_badge`, and `white_space`. Public state APIs include
`content` / `set_content()`, `actions_visible` / `show_actions()` /
`hide_actions()`, `action_elements()` / `action_values()`, and
`overlay_slot` for attaching a bubble-local overlay.

### `NoticeBubble`

```python
NoticeBubble("You joined the group")
```

The centered system message — a muted pill that centers itself in a
flex message column (`align-self: center`) with a translucent
background. `text` is the message, or pass `content` for a custom
element; `text` is settable.

## Rich text & scrolling

### `RichText`

```python
from neony.application.elements import ImageSegment, RichText, TextSegment

editor = RichText(segments=["你好", ImageSegment(src="x.png"), "世界"])
editor.insert_image("y.png", at_caret=True)  # lands at the caret
editor.on_change(lambda e: print(e.value))  # ordered segments
editor.on_submit(lambda e: send())  # Enter (IME-safe)
segments = editor.content()  # [TextSegment, ImageSegment, ...]
```

An inline `contenteditable` editor. Text and image segments coexist in
the live DOM, and the editor keeps typing, IME composition, and the
caret stable across Neony renders. Flat positions count one per text
character and one per inline image.

- `content() -> list[TextSegment | ImageSegment]` — ordered content.
- `set_content(segments)` — replace programmatically.
- `insert_text(text, *, at_caret=True)` / `insert_image(src, *, at_caret=True, alt="", width=None, height=None)`. Images display at `40×40px` by default; custom dimensions are capped at `320×240px`, with width also constrained to the editor container.
- `caret_position()` / `selection_range()` / `set_caret(position)` / `focus()`.
- When an image is pasted, RichText reads image bytes from the system clipboard and replaces the browser-created `blob:` image; no extra configuration is required, and the image display cap still applies.
- Events: `on_change` (`event.value` is the segment list), `on_submit`
  (Enter; the default newline is suppressed), `on_input`, `on_click`,
  `on_paste_files` (raw synthetic paste event), `on_paste_image`
  (`event.value` is a list of temp file paths).

### `ScrollArea`

```python
area = ScrollArea(message_list)
await area.scroll_to_bottom()
await area.scroll_to_top()
await area.scroll_to(120, behavior="smooth")
```

A scrollable vertical region with programmatic scrolling. Mount in a
definite-height flex parent (`flex_grow + flex_basis:0 + min_height:0`
on the component).

### `StickToBottom`

```python
stick = StickToBottom(message_list)
await stick.scroll_to_bottom(force=True)
await stick.scroll_to(240)
```

The chat-stream scroll container. It auto-pins while the user is near
the bottom; scrolling up pauses the pin, and scrolling back near the
bottom resumes it. `scroll_to_bottom(force=True)` scrolls regardless of
the current pin state; `scroll_to(top)` restores a pixel offset. The
same mounting requirement as `ScrollArea` applies.


## Drag & reorder

### `Reorder` component

The ready-made way to reorder a collection is the `Reorder` board — a
flex container of draggable cards:

`ReorderContent` is the accepted card-content type: a reactive string,
`Component`, or raw `DOMElement`. It is exported from
`neony.application.elements` and also used by `ReorderItem[T]` as the
content type parameter.

```python
from neony.application.elements import Reorder, ReorderItem

board = Reorder(
    ReorderItem("First", key="a"),
    ReorderItem("Second", key="b"),
    "Third",  # plain strings become cards (key = label)
    direction="row",  # "row" or "column"
    wrap=True,  # row + wrap = a grid (both axes)
    size="76px",  # card size along the main axis
    max_width="336px",  # optional — pin 4 cards/row to force the wrap
)
board.on_drop(lambda e: e.value)  # ordered keys after a drag
board.order  # current keys in render order
```

- Cards are pre-marked draggable, and `drop` reorders the board itself.
- Both axes work: the board follows its `direction`, judging the
  insertion side by the cursor's half — `offset_x` for a `row` (first
  half inserts before, second after), `offset_y` for a `column`.

  A wrapping `row` board forms a grid, so a card can be dragged both
  horizontally (within a row) and vertically (into another row). The
  grid wraps at the board's width — pin `max_width` to force the wrap.
- Cards are not limited to text: `add()` / the constructor accept any
  content — a plain or reactive string, a whole `Component` (it mounts
  inside the card), or a raw `DOMElement`. **Bare content needs no
  wrapper and no explicit key**: plain strings use the label as the key,
  keyed DOM elements keep their own key, and everything else (a stack of
  `Card`s, …) gets an auto-generated `reorder-card-N` key.
- **Generic over card content** — `Reorder[T]` and `ReorderItem[T]` are
  typed by what the cards contain, so any component (or any other
  content type) can be used anywhere `ReorderItem` is expected, and
  `items` yields `ReorderItem[T]`:

  ```python
  from neony.application.elements import Card, Text

  board: Reorder[Card] = Reorder(Card(title="One"), Card(title="Two"))
  cards = board.items  # list[ReorderItem[Card]] — content typed as Card
  ```
- Boards exchange cards: dragging a card onto a card of another `Reorder`
  re-homes the landing slot into that board and the drop moves the card
  (it is removed from the source board's `order` and inserted into the
  target's). Card keys must be globally unique across the boards you
  let exchange cards.
- `on_drop` fires with `event.value` = the ordered card keys of the
  board that received the drop.

For the low-level drag primitive (`drag_payload`, drag lifecycle
events), see the [DOM & CSS → Drag & reorder](/api/dom-css) section.
