# Installation and platforms


Neony renders Python-built DOM trees inside a native WebView. Installing the
Python package is necessary but not always sufficient: the WebView and some
optional desktop integrations are supplied by the operating system.

## Python environments

For an application installed from the package index:

```bash
python -m pip install neony
```

To build or modify the repository itself, use the development setup
documented in [Contributing](https://github.com/HarcicYang/Neony/blob/117e6a3/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Linux

The project develops and verifies primarily on Linux Wayland. The native WebView
binding links against the **WebKitGTK 4.1** API (GTK 3, libsoup 3), so every
distribution needs the package that provides `libwebkit2gtk-4.1.so.0`. Package
names differ across distributions; the commands below cover the common ones.

### Development dependencies

Debian and Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libxdo-dev
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libxdo-devel
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 xdotool
```

openSUSE:

```bash
sudo zypper install libwebkit2gtk-4_1-0-devel gtk3-devel libxdo-devel
```

> Each `-dev`/`-devel`/plain package above pulls in the matching WebKitGTK 4.1
> runtime, GTK 3, and libsoup 3 automatically through the dependency graph.

### Runtime dependencies for a packaged application

A packaged application needs the matching WebKitGTK **runtime** rather than the
compiler headers alone. Install only the runtime package on the target machine:

```text
Debian/Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0
Fedora        : sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1
Arch Linux    : sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1
openSUSE      : sudo zypper install libwebkit2gtk-4_1-0
```

### Optional system tray dependency

The native tray integration dynamically loads this library at runtime, so it is
optional rather than a hard link:

```text
Debian/Ubuntu : libayatana-appindicator3-1  (+ libayatana-appindicator3-dev for building)
Fedora        : libayatana-appindicator-gtk3
Arch Linux    : libayatana-appindicator
openSUSE      : libayatana-appindicator3-1
```

If it is unavailable, the windowed application still runs; tray creation is
logged and skipped by the application layer.

### Wayland and X11

Wayland is the primary Linux desktop target. The Linux blur path uses the
compositor's background-effect protocol where supported; positioning is also
subject to Wayland restrictions. X11 is not a complete support target at this
stage.

## Windows

Windows uses the operating system's WebView2 runtime. Install or enable the
WebView2 runtime before running an application. Native window materials such
as Acrylic and Mica depend on the platform and window configuration.

Individual features should still be verified on the target Windows version
before shipping.

## macOS

macOS uses WKWebView supplied by the system. File dialogs use `osascript` and
transparent windows can request a native blur effect. WKWebView does not expose
all filesystem metadata in a web drop event, so applications that depend on
file paths should use the Neony native drop channel and test on the target OS.

The macOS runtime and HiDPI/mixed-DPI behavior are platform-specific
verification work.

## HEVC / codec fallback

WebView media pipelines do not guarantee HEVC (`hvc1` / `hev1`) support.
When a managed `Video` or `Audio` loads a local MP4 the runtime cannot
decode, it detects the codec and transcodes the file to H.264 with
`imageio-ffmpeg`. The wheel ships a static ffmpeg binary, so no system
`ffmpeg` or media toolchain is required. The result is cached next to the
original as `<file>.transcoded.mp4` and reused on later launches.

## Native file dialogs

The public async methods are:

```python
path = await app.open_file()
paths = await app.open_files()
destination = await app.save_file(default_name="output.txt")
folder = await app.select_folder()
```

The platform implementation is selected automatically:

```text
Linux   → zenity when available, otherwise tkinter
macOS   → osascript
Windows → PowerShell
Other   → tkinter fallback
```

The picker opens asynchronously, so the application keeps responding
while it is open. A cancelled single-selection call
returns `None`; a cancelled multi-selection call returns `[]`. File filters are
passed as `(label, pattern)` pairs, for example:

```python
filetypes = [("PNG images", "*.png"), ("All files", "*.*")]
```

If a platform command or fallback cannot open, the public API normalizes the
usual failure/cancel result to the same empty shape. Test picker behavior on the
platform where the application will ship.

## Common symptoms

| Symptom | First checks |
| --- | --- |
| WebView fails to start on Linux | Confirm the WebKitGTK runtime and GTK libraries are installed; check the process stderr. |
| Tray icon is missing | Install `libayatana-appindicator`; tray creation is optional and may be skipped. |
| File picker does not appear | Check `zenity`/`osascript`/PowerShell or tkinter, plus the display/session environment. |
| A transparent window has no blur | Check compositor/platform support; blur failure is non-fatal and leaves the window usable. |
